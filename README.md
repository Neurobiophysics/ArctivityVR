This GitHub repository contains code designed for the analysis of Arc TXN images and calcium activity, focusing on key processes essential for accurate data interpretation. The provided tools enable users to:

Motion Correction: Stabilize images to correct for movement artifacts, ensuring that the observed changes in signal are due to actual biological activity rather than shifts in the imaging field.
Signal Extraction: Isolate and measure the calcium signals from neurons, allowing for the quantification of neural activity.
Image Registration: Align images from different time points or conditions, making it possible to compare and contrast biological events accurately across datasets.
Image Filtering: Enhance image quality by reducing noise, thereby improving the visibility of relevant features and signals.
